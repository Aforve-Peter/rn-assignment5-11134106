React Native Theme Toggle Application
Welcome to my React Native Theme Toggle Application! This app lets users switch seamlessly between light and dark themes. It features a Home Screen displaying user profiles and transactions, and a Settings Screen for adjusting various settings, including the theme toggle. The design closely matches the provided UI mockup.

To get started, clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/your-username/rn-assignment5-ID.git and navigate to the project directory with cd rn-assignment5-ID. Install the dependencies using npm install. You can then run the app using npx react-native run-ios for iOS or npx react-native run-android for Android.

The app is built with React Native, using react-native-vector-icons for icons and the Context API for managing the global theme state. This ensures a smooth and responsive user interface.

Here are some screenshots of the application:
